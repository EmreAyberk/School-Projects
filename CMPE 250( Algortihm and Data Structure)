Course Description:

he CMPE 250 course is the last of the sequence of introductory programming courses at Bogazici (CMPE 150-160-250) and 
is one of the key courses in the entire curriculum. The focus is on algorithm design, 
reductions and the choice of appropriate data structures for solving computational problems. 
Programming methodology is based on the widely-used C++ programming language. 
Emphasis is on good programming style, learning the ecosystem of the C++ language and the standard template library (STL).


My Opinion About This Course:

It is really helpful course because there are a lot of algorithms and theories about Computer Scientists.
Also there are a lot of simulation like "Discerete Event Simulation".
It is one of my favorite course which I learn really good things.
